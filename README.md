# factoryμ
###### a mediocre factory builder in love2d

## about
made for siege week 10 (the end wow), this is a pretty awful factory builder.
no theme this week, so that's neat. however i struggled so damn much on this
one. i did all of in the final two days, which was rough.

also, i used love2d which i've never really used before. coming up with an idea
for this one was the hardest part, which is why i did nothing until so late.

## tech stack i guess
 - love2d
 - lua
 - zed
 - inkscape
